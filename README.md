Welcome to my project portfolio!

My name is Rémi Maillon. I am a French petroleum engineer and data scientist.
I am currently attending the post graduate program in AI & Machine Learning with the University of Texas at Austin (McCombs school of business).

Below is a list of data science projects I have been working on:

* University of Texas at Austin – Post Graduate program in AI & Machine Learning:
  - Project 1: Foundations for AI & ML – MovieLens Data Exploration (Pandas, NumPy, Visualisation techniques, EDA).
  - Project 2: Supervised Learning – Loans Campaign Target Prediction (Supervised Learning, Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation, EDA).
  - Project 3: Ensemble Techniques – Travel Package Purchase Prediction (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, Model Evaluation, EDA)
  - Project 4:  Feature Selection and Model Tuning  - Credit card users churn prediction (Hyperparameter Tuning, Grid & Random Search, Model Evaluation, EDA, Business recommendations)
  - Project 5: Unsupervised Learning – Credit card customer segmentation (K-means & Hierarchical clustering, Dendograms, Silhouette plots, EDA)

* JEDHA (Paris) – Full stack data science program: Project in partnership with Carmignac Investment Fund (Asset Management firm based in Paris). Predicting and understanding customers’ behaviour (EDA, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Correlations, Feature Importance).

* Oil Production interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly. Deployment with Heroku. Automated decline curve analysis to predict wells oil production using Python SciPy.
