Hello and welcome to my project portfolio!

My name is Rémi Maillon. I am a French petroleum engineer and data scientist.
I am currently attending the post graduate program in AI & Machine Learning with the University of Texas at Austin (McCombs school of business).

Below is a list of data science projects I have been working on:

* University of Texas at Austin – Post Graduate program in AI & Machine Learning:
  - Project 1: Foundations for AI & ML – MovieLens Data Exploration (Pandas, NumPy, Visualisation techniques, EDA).
  - Project 2: Supervised Learning – Loans Campaign Target Prediction (Supervised Learning, Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation, EDA).
  - Project 3: Ensemble Techniques – Travel Package Purchase Prediction (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, Model Evaluation, EDA)
  - Project 4: Feature Selection, Model Selection and Tuning - Credit card users churn prediction (Cross Validation, Up and Down Sampling, Regularization, Pipelines and Hyper-parameters Tuning)
  - Project 5: Unsupervised Learning – Credit card customer segmentation (K-means & Hierarchical clustering, Dendograms, Silhouette plots, EDA)
  - Project 6: Introduction to Neural Networks – Bank churn prediction (TensorFlow, Keras, Artificial Neural Networks)
  - Project 7: Introduction to Computer Vision – Image classification (Convolution Neural Networks, Image Pre-processing using cv2, Colab)

* JEDHA (Paris) – Full stack data science program: Project in partnership with Carmignac Investment Fund (Asset Management firm based in Paris). Predicting and understanding customers’ behaviour (EDA, Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Correlations, Feature Importance).

* Oil field production interactive dashboards: 
  - With Dash and Plotly. Deployment with Heroku.
  - With Tableau
 
* Automated decline curve analysis to predict oil wells production using Python SciPy.
